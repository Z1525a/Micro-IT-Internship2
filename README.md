 File Encryption/Decryption Tool is a security application designed to protect sensitive files from unauthorized access. It achieves this by transforming files into an encrypted (coded) format that is unreadable without the appropriate key or password. Decryption reverses the process, restoring the file to its original readable form when access is required.

Key Features:
File Selection Interface: Allows users to browse and choose files from their system.
Encryption Algorithm: Implements strong encryption methods (e.g., AES) to secure file content.
Decryption Process: Restores encrypted files to their original state using the correct key.
Password/Key Management: Requires a secure key or password for both encryption and decryption.
User-Friendly UI: Simplifies the encryption and decryption process with intuitive buttons and prompts.
Error Handling: Alerts users of incorrect keys, unsupported file formats, or missing files.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on major operating systems (optional enhancement).

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
